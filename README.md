Sadly, this homework assignment will require a redo. I encountered a lot of technical issues that really slowed down my progress. I was moving along really well before I became stuck after 2.2.4 I never really did recover. 

I received great assistance with my tutor, but it was really fast-paced and I worked until midnight. the follow days were loaded with work demands and my mother's doctor appointments. When I returned to the project, I got lost.

There was a problem with one of the videos that required me to stop and look around for the answers for what I needed to do to continue. Shortly after that interuption, I ran into more difficulty adn there wasn't a sample of the code I should have eneded with, so I was completely lost.

These are a few examples of the problems I've encountered just to share that I really did try.
