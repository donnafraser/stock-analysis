Sadly, this homework assignment will require a redo. I encountered some material and technical issues that slowed down my progress. I was moving along well before I became stuck after 2.2.4. I don't think I ever recovered. 

I received assistance from my tutor, but it was really fast-paced and I worked on things based on what notes I could jot down. The follow days were loaded with work and family demands. When I returned to the project, sadly, I was lost. I am not giving up, but I just don't have a solid project to submit, but I will resubmit when I am able to return and do the entire module again for a second shot at my grade.

For detail, there was a problem with one of the videos that required me to stop and look around for the answer to continue. Shortly after that interruption, I ran into more difficulty. For this section of our work, there wasn't a sample of the code to compare my progress.  I just felt completely lost.

To make it really fun, I wasn't able to figure out if all my file uploads to GitHub were actually there - committed with updated files or not. Doh!

These are a few examples of the problems I've encountered just to share that I really did try.

Couldn't pull Challenger Starter Code.vbs  (Really? Am I supposed to be able to download/save as .vbs? I looked, and tried, no success :( )

This was one of two issues I had and tried to solve before I Slacked AskBCS for help.

Was happy I figured out how to do this part, but once I had the file open in text editor, I wasn't really sure how I was supposed to use it. Grrrr....

I will resubmit this work. Right now, I am just submitting everything I did with .png resources I can make, even if the coding is not correct. I will recover and redo!!!

I will prevail! 
LOL! Thanks for letting me process all of this frustration. Typing this out kinda helped. Thanks for listening.....
